My soul is eternal. And, I am here, on Earth, full of love and peace,
doubt and fear. I am individual, yet I am connected to all matter. I am
a drop in the universe; I am the universe. In the day to day, I 
wrestle with wanting to understand how the fabric of my life is 
unfolding, minute by minute. I want to know its design, the patterns of 
its threads, where it's going - so, I can get it "right." I hope to stop this pattern of wanting to measure up to being worthy of my life. I hope to live as the eternal spirit I am - wholly spirited - in my day to day life, and inspire others to do so, as well.
