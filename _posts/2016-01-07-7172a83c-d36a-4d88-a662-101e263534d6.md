I first met espresso as a Midwestern _naif_ at a cafe in Paris in 1986\. I loved its frothy beauty. I loved its teeny little cup. I loved the _'tink tink'_ sound my equally tiny spoon made as I stirred in my 2 (okay 3, or 4) sugar cubes. I sipped, then gulped. All the hairs on the top of my head stood up straight for the next two days. We've been inseparable ever since.
